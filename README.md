YamlGenerator is an application that performs next:

1) Randomly generates an array of integers where each integer has duplicate and only one does not have it;
2) Writes this array to YAML file;
3) Then reads back this array from the YAML file;
4) Finds out the unique integer that does not have duplicate and prints it.

Application uses two external libraries - guava-18.0 and yamlbeans-1.09.
